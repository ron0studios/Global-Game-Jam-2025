## Gameplay
### Controls
- Arrow keys + ctrl for P1
- WASD + LSHIFT for P2
- IJKL + U for P3
- FTGH + R for P4

The aim of the game for each player is to keep their main bubble (outlined in their color) above water, 
whilst trying to collect as many smaller bubbles as you can! When more than 1 player comes into play, use
tactics to try and push your opponent bubbles away or sabotage players by trying to pop their bubbles!

Move *Down* to sink under water. The deeper you go before you let go, the higher you can jump! 
Hold your secondary button (ctrl/Lshift/U/R) to breathe in, and let go to blow. Longer holding can lead to a stronger
force to push up bubbles.
You can pop and damage player bubbles (including your own!) by shooting up and bashing against them with your beak.
You can pop smaller bubbles in the same way.

**Have fun!**
